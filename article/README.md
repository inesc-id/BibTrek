# BibTrek Article

Here we present a brief article explaining the motivation, functionalities and future work about the Bibtrek application.

# A brief note from the author

It might seem odd to casual observer of this repository the reason on why there is an article written for this application. After all it is just a mere prototype.

It is important being said that the goal of this article was for the author to get familiar with the art of writing a good research paper, since he plans on going for a scientific research career on the computer science area, and to experiment with the LaTeX document preparation system.

Nonetheless, this article serves the purpose of introducing the BibTrek prototype, one of Professor Miguel Pardal master thesis projects. The author considers BibTrek a very useful tool for researchers and students alike because it allows the research and correlation of cybersecutiry information using a graph visualization tool that would allow for an easy search and query of any publication.

Finally, this was a way for the author to known what's to come during the writing of his M.Sc.. thesis and the researching aspect of the game after concluding the said thesis.
